While there are many mobile apps to parse the health data in the iPhone, I wanted to get a closer look at what the data is.

In this project, I exported the Apple Health data from my phone into a file called "export.xml". With the export.xml in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook, I show some of what I found during this experiment.

You can export your own data, download this code and look at your workout activities or modify and explore other aspects of the Health Kit data.

I did visualize the data with Tableau, but this notebook simply has some python parsing code and looking at specific activities to explore what story the data told me.
